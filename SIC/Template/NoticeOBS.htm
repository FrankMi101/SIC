                            Hello <u>[MentorSTR] </u>,
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            First of all I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for taking on the
                            role of Mentor in support of our NTIP teacher, <u>[TeacherNameSTR] </u>.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The relationship that you are developing with the <u>[TeacherNameSTR] </u>is envisioned
                            as a supportive one, with you acting as a role model, a coach, and an advisor to
                            the new teacher, sharing your experience and knowledge about teaching on an ongoing
                            basis. This relationship is based on trust and confidentiality. The desired outcomes
                            are improved skills and knowledge for new teachers, as well as a more collaborative
                            and professional environment in our schools.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Your time and commitment is truly a special gift, one that is much appreciated and
                            never forgotten by your mentee. The mentoring process enables the Mentor and Mentee
                            to grow and develop as professionals and it contributes to a more collaborative
                            and collegial culture within a Catholic School Community.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            
                            
                            The NTIP Committee offers Mentor training. Please contact   <a href="mailto:agatha-julia.nemes@tcdsb.org"> Aggie Nemes (agatha-julia.nemes@tcdsb.org) </a> 
                            for more information about the program.  Training sessions (for new NTIP mentors) are being offered on PAL.

                            <br />
                            At this time I recommend that you review the Ministry document about Mentorship-these will assist you in better understanding your role. Please see the document
                            at <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teacher/NTIPMentor.pdf">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teacher/NTIPMentor.pdf</a>
